# thesis
Welcome to the online appendix of my thesis.

First of, some programs are necessary for the python code, namely: Anaconda, Implicit.py and Visual Tools.

Anaconda can be downloaded on https://www.anaconda.com/download/  (download the python 3.6 version).

Visual Tools can be downloaded on https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017 (it's one of the free downloads, but I don't know which).

Implicit.py needs to be installed through the anaconda prompt, and here is a YouTube video that explains the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Kxg-EYvxM (the necessary command is "pip install implicit.py").

Second, the dataset is available on request, by mailing p.j.manders@uvt.nl.

Furthermore, if anything is not clear or some code is not working, feel free to contact me on my email.

Happy coding!
